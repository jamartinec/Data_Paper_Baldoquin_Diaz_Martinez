The models have been implemented using the Pyomo language. In all cases we use the Pyomo class of abstract models.

GJJ_f1: model with objective function f1
GJJ_f2: model with objective function f2
GJJ_f3: model with objective function f3

resolver.py:  Contains the Pyomo commands that call the abstract model, the data and the Gurobi solver.
postprocess2.py: Organize the answers obtained by Gurobi in an .xls file.
